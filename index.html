          <p>We probably should have crossed paths sooner. For years, Eric worked
          at UCLA while Laurel was a student there, but despite sharing many
          common interests we never met on campus. We happened to
          meet at a party a few years later when we were both working at
          museums, and quickly became friends.</p>
          
          <p>After a year or two of getting to know each other as friends and
          colleagues, we both realized we wanted more out of the
          relationship and began dating; we've been inseperable ever since.</p>

        <div class='section__content'>
          <p>Over the years we have shared some pretty great adventures: we've gotten
          to know the weird places of the desert outside of LA, visited utopian
          architectural communes, and bicycled 300 miles from Eureka to San
          Francisco. In the summer of 2016 we went on one of our greatest
          adventures yet, an epic trip to Greece and Berlin.</p>
          
          <p>Eric proposed on the slopes of the Acropolis overlooking Athens.
          Laurel said yes, and now we hope that you can join us to celebrate
          in one of our favorite places.</p>
